# AR-Book
AR Book is an application that allows you to place 3D objects or assets on a drawing or sketch. It was created with the Unity engine, and the picture target is stored in the Vuforia (AR SDK) Image target database. The major reason for creating this app was to utilise it for learning purposes for small children. It has various drawings/sketches, including the sun, car, house, aeroplane, and ship. When a mobile camera is put on this target drawing, the appropriate 3D object is inserted in the augmented or virtual environment.
